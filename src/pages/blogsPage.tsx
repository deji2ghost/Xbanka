          Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that allows users to send and
          receive payments without relying on banks or other intermediaries. It
          was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the name
          Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin operates on a
          decentralized network called blockchain, which records all
          transactions transparently and securely. Bitcoin is often used as a
          store of value, similar to gold, and as a means of payment for goods
          and services. It is limited to 21 million coins, making it scarce and
          resistant to inflation. Transactions are verified by a process called
          mining, where computers solve complex mathematical problems to confirm
          transactions and secure the network.
